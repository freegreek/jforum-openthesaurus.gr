jforum for OpenThesaurus.gr
===========================

Following the example of OpenThesaurus.de we considered it good to include a customized
version of jforum in the application, so that users can discuss matters related to
synonyms etc.

Thanks a lot to Daniel Naber, author and maintainer of upstream OpenThesaurus project
for releasing his customizations to jforum and to the people at 
http://code.google.com/p/jforum2/ for keeping up with maintainance of jforum (bug
fixes, updated dependencies etc).
